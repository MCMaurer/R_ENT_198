## Course Description

Data management and analysis are crucial aspects of the modern scientific process, but they can seem daunting at first. This course will serve as a gentle introduction to data management, analysis, and visualization using the R programming language and the RStudio environment. The course will consist of live-coding sessions, where instructors write code along with students, and hands-on computing exercises. It will cover a large portion of the data analysis pipeline, from data entry and management to analysis and visualization. This is **not** a statistics course, though the basic framework for conducting statistical analyses in R will be covered. Finally, the last few classes will consist of work sessions, where students can work on their own data with the instructors available to help.

## Instructor Contacts

The best way to reach the instructors is via email. Michael can be reached at [mjculshawmaurer@ucdavis.edu](mailto:mjculshawmaurer@ucdavis.edu) and Hanna at [hkahl@ucdavis.edu](mailto:hkahl@ucdavis.edu). We will use email and [the Canvas site](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/305607) to distribute course information.

## Course Prerequisites

No experience with R, RStudio, or data analysis is required. The following programs must be installed by the first class meeting: **the latest versions of R and RStudio, and a spreadsheet management software (Excel or something similar).**

## Course Purpose

The goal of this course is not for students to master all aspects of the data science pipeline, but to help students to become more comfortable with the process and more confident in their abilities to learn more. Students will learn to manage projects and data, read and write their data in R, manipulate and clean up data, and create high-quality visualizations.

## Course Objectives

Students completing this course should learn to:

- Properly format and manage raw data
- Create clean and readable project directories
- Import and export data using R
- Clean, summarize, and prepare data for analysis
- Create high-quality visualizations
- Work with the R language
- Seek further knowledge about R and data analysis
- Apply these skills to their own data

# Computer Setup


Welcome! There's a few things we'd like everyone to try and get sorted out *before* our first class. Please plan on bringing your laptop (and a charger if your battery isn't going to hold for 2 hrs) to each class.

## Please complete these 3 main tasks before our first class:
 
 1. Install *current* [**R**](https://cran.rstudio.com/) on your laptop
 
 2. Install *current* [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your laptop
 
 3. <i class="fa fa-table fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> &nbsp; Make sure you have a spreadsheet program installed on your computer (Microsoft Office, Libre Office, etc.)

Read below for more detailed information on installing the pieces of software we'll need, and platform specific instructions.

<br>


## R & RStudio

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. **R** is the underlying statistical computing environment. **RStudio** is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install `R` before you install **RStudio**. Download and install both of these but in this order:

 1. [**R**](http://cran.rstudio.com/): Get the most current version version appropriate for your machine. It's free.

 2. [**RStudio**](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is a great platform to work with R (note you need R before you can use RStudio). Please install the most recent version. It's free. It does lots of cool things. We'll talk more about it in class.

### Windows


#### If you already have `R` and `RStudio` installed

* Open `RStudio`, and click on *Help* > *Check for updates*. If a new version is
    available, quit `RStudio`, and download the latest version for `RStudio`.
* To check which version of `R` you are using, start `RStudio` and the first thing
  that appears in the console indicates the version of `R` you are
  running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display
  which version of `R` you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it. You can [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for
  more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.

#### If you don't have `R` and `RStudio` installed

* Download `R` from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows
  XP/Vista/7/8** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open `RStudio` to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

### macOS


#### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open `RStudio`, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
    available, quit `RStudio`, and download the latest version for `RStudio`.
* To check the version of R you are using, start `RStudio` and the first thing
  that appears on the terminal indicates the version of `R` you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of `R` you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it.

#### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download `R` from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the latest `R` version
* Double click on the downloaded file to install `R`
* It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed
  by some packages)
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**
  (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install `RStudio`
* Once it's installed, open `RStudio` to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


### Linux

* Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information
  to get the most recent version of `R` for common distributions. For most
  distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
  `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we
  don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
  usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least `R 3.4.3`
* Go to the
  [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and
  install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i
  rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
* Once it's installed, open `RStudio` to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.
  
## Spreadsheet program

To interact with spreadsheets, we can use LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, or other programs. Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.

If you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you can use LibreOffice. It's a free, open source spreadsheet program. Alternatively, as a UC Davis student, you are eligible for a free copy of Microsoft Office 365. See [here for instructions](http://officedownload.ucdavis.edu/), make sure to login with your UC Davis email address. 

### Windows

- Download the Installer 
  - Install LibreOffice by going to [the installation page](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/). The version for Windows should automatically be selected. Click Download Version X.X.X (whichever is the most recent version). You will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one. Your download should begin automatically.
- Install LibreOffice 
- Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and LibreOffice should install.

### Mac OS X
